# Workspace:

it's a folder which you define in which path it should be.

It's the way which golang organizes your projects.

golang usually keeps all the projects in this folder.
its golang's solution for organizing the projects.
It's better for you to only have one workspace folder in your system for keeping all your projects.

For defining the workspace path you have to set GOPATH local variable, but when you
install the compiler of golang, based on your operating system, it sets the value of
GOPATH local variable.

Ex in windows ==> c:\Users\Amir\go

# command for seeing the value of  GOPATH ==> go env

=====================================================================

Workspace folder contains several folders:

    src ==> for managing the code which we write ==> all codes which we write
    or libraries which we add/import to projects from github, are in this folder

    pkg ==> for keeping non-executable files (shared libraries)

    bin ==> for keeping binary - executable files of golang.
    every tool which install by "go install" will keep in this folder.


Ex of bin ==> you can install programs which are written in golang on your os
              using "go install" command

Ex: go install github.com/hhatto/gocloc/cmd/gocloc@latest

this program counts the lines of the codes only

now check bin folder to see the exe file of above repository \:D/

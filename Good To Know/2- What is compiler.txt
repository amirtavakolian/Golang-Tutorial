What is compiler?
Compiler is also a software which is written by a programming language like
c, c++, java, golang & etc...
Which converts/translates the code which humans write & understand easier (high level code),
to a code/language (instructions) which CPU can understand
( 0 & 1 == machine code == instruction (list of works like cooking) )

Ex: golang compiler is written with golang :D ==>

in computer, everything is 0 & 1 :D

Ex ==> echo "hello world"  ==> compiler ==> 010101010101010101011111000000101010011100001111111000


echo "hello world" ==> understand-able for human

01010101010101001  ==> understand-able for machine - cpu

# Difference between compiler and interpreter languages:

Imagine an English translator which we give him a text and tell him
bring it to your house, translate it, and come to a live tv show and read from that.

Now imagine another English translator which we don't give him a text previously.
We tell him to come to the TV show and start translating in real-time
=>
So it's harder than the first translator & it has more complexity and more time-consuming
But the first translator has done the translating and now his ready from before and read it so fast

this is one of the difference between compiler and which is an interpreter languages
==> having better performance (speed of executing)
meanwhile, the interpreter languages have done several works for having better performance.

speed of executing is high in compiler langs because the codes are compiled to machine code from before
not at run time and when we run them they run in a row without any break
==>
but the interpreter reads our code we have written and translate them to machine code at runtime
so it takes some time for translating

so, the performance is one of the difference between the interpreter and compiler languages

--------------------------------

consider an auto drive car which the driver tells it, go to kianpars.
the car doesn't know what kianpars is.

but, inside that car, there will be codes which convert our sound to lat & long
and a compiler or interpreter which convert - compile our sound to language of that
car's operating system cpu :D

=============================================

What is binary file?

binary file is a computer file that is not text file (its content is not plain text)
==> binary file is often used as a term meaning non-text file which its content is not plaing text
(each file which is not text is called binary)

lozoman ye file E binary, ye file E ejraii nist ==> ye seri file ke be sorate
2 2ii hastesh por az عدد va... hastesh ke beheshon migim machine code :D

ye file E binary ke mohtavash ye tasviri hastesh ya masalan ye document E word ke hamashon

file haie text vase ma fahmeshon (fahme mohtavash) kheili sadast va ina joze file haie binary hesab nemishan

package main

/*

# golang's compiler commands:
go help

====================================================================

# for compiling & running a program use ==> go build & go run


# go build  ==> compile our code to a binary file

Ex:
go build -o my_program main.go

-o  ==> define the name of the output binary file

with above code, your program will be compiled and build (get created)
so, you can run that program. ==> ./my_program

---------------------------------------------------

# go run:

no need to binary file (no need to give our program to anybody),
just for testing if our program works without any error or problem.
use go run command

"go run" will run the process of building our program (go build)
then run it without binary output, so there is no need to run it
manually with command line  Ex: ./my_program.exe


"go run" will create an exe file but put it in a temporary path and run that.
when the program run and finish, that exe file which is created with "go run"
will be deleted.

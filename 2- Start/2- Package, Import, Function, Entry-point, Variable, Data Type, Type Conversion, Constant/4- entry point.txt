Each golang software has an entry point.

When we run the "go build" or "go run" commands, when the compiler wants to start reading our codes
and convert them to machine code and create an execute-able file from the code,
It needs an entry point to a start from. ==> it looks like a source and destination

This entry point defines where the compiler should start compiling from.

-------------------------------------

in golang softwares, the entry point, must be in a package called main
==> the package name MUST/SHOULD be main,
in that package, there should be a function called main.

So this main function will be the entry point of our software.

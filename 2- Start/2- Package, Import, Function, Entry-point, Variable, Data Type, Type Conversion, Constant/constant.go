/*

Sometimes we have values that are fixed and not change.
Ex: the number of days in a week, so you have to hardcode and duplicate the number 7

Now imagine instead of the days in a week, you want to calculate the days in a months.
So you have to change the number seven in different places in your code

Instead of that you can use constant

another example ==> P number  3.14
